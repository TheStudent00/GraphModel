# Graph Model Intellectual Property (IP) Description
**Version 9.2 — Recursive Grammar & Cylindrical Time**

This document captures the conceptual, architectural, and theoretical foundations of the Graph Model Oracle, defining the novel components, structural primitives, and meta-learning dynamics protected under the OTU Green License.

Version 9.2 introduces the **Recursive Expression Engine** (a learnable grammatical compute model) and **Cylindrical Time** (hierarchical rotary embeddings), integrating them with the **Fractal Topology** and **Relativistic Economics** of Versions 6–9.

# 1. Purpose and Scope

This description asserts IP protection over:

- **The Recursive Fractal Architecture:** The nesting of Modules within Modules (Internal Sparsity).
- **LossComplexity (The Relativistic Barrier):** A regulatory energy model where complexity cost asymptotes to infinity near the limit.
- **Recursive Expression Engine:** A grammatical compute model replacing fixed topologies with learnable syntax trees (The Pipe).
- **Cylindrical Time:** A hierarchical rotary embedding scheme (Day/Hour) enabling infinite context scaling with local precision.
- **Continuous Normalization:** A differentiable manifold (Phi) that learns to interpolate between Linear, Softmax, and Gating behaviors.
- **Impedance Regulation:** Connection costs based on Fractal Tree Distance.
- **Universal Linearization:** Z-Order (Metric) and Spectral (Relational) input linearization.
- **Bicameral Autopoiesis:** Active (Read-Only) vs. Reflective (Write-Access) Minds.
- **Feature Factorization:** Decoupling features into Spline (Physics), Permutation (Geometry), and Noise (Entropy).

# 2. High-Level Summary

The Graph Model is a **Fractal Organism**. It is composed of **Minds** (Hemispheres), which contain **Modules**, which recursively contain **Sub-Modules**.

Computationally, the system abandons fixed layers in favor of a **Recursive Expression Engine**. Instead of a static architecture, Modules parse learnable syntax trees, executing a **Sequential Reduction** (Pipe) on inputs. To handle unbounded streams, it utilizes **Cylindrical Time**, mapping linear sequence data into a hierarchical spiral (Day/Hour).

The system is regulated by a **Dual-Economy**:
1.  **Internal Economy (LossComplexity):** A relativistic budget constraint that governs the expansion of the fractal (Parent distributes tokens to Children).
2.  **External Economy (Logistics):** A market mechanism that governs the flow of information between modules (Sender pays Time, Receiver pays Space).

# 3. The Fractal Hierarchy

## 3.1 The Mind (Global Container)
The highest level of abstraction, organized Bicamerally to ensure safety during self-modification.
* **Active Mind (Hemisphere A):** Real-time, read-only execution. Optimized for inference speed. Uses **Universal Linearization** (Z-Order/Spectral) to ingest any data type.
* **Reflective Mind (Hemisphere B):** Deep-time, write-enabled simulation. Contains **Version Control** (Backtracking) and the **MindsEye** executive.

## 3.2 The Module (Recursive Agent)
A Module is a self-similar container acting as both a computational unit and a structural node.
* **Public Face (The Trinity):** The default computational cycle: Context (Sensor) $\to$ State (Integrator) $\to$ Service (Actuator).
* **Private Internals (Internal Sparsity):** A list of **Sub-Modules**. These are strictly private implementation details, allowing a Module to become a complex network internally without exposing that complexity to the global graph.
* **Virtual Identity:** Modules exist virtually (consuming zero complexity) until accessed. Upon realization, they incur a **Phantom Latency** to smooth the gradient shock to the Rhythm system.

# 4. The Economic Physics (Regulation)

## 4.1 LossComplexity (The Relativistic Barrier)
To prevent unbounded expansion, every Module enforces a **Relativistic Barrier** on its total complexity mass (Self + Realized Sub-Modules).
* **The Barrier Function:** $Cost \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (C/C_{limit})^2}}$.
* **Effect:** As a module approaches its complexity limit, the "cost" of adding a new atom or realizing a sub-module approaches infinity. This forces the optimization landscape to prioritize **Compression** and **Sparsity** over expansion.

## 4.2 Impedance (Topological Regulation)
Connections between Public Modules are regulated by the **Impedance Curve**.
* **Tree Distance:** Cost is calculated based on the shortest path in the recursion tree ($\Delta L$).
* **Function:** $Cost(\Delta L)$ is a learnable monotone spline. This prevents "Small World" collapse by making long-range or cross-branch connections expensive (high Space token cost).

## 4.3 Internal Rhythm (Temporal Regulation)
The system optimizes for **Isochrony** (predictable timing).
* **ETA Prediction:** Modules predict response latency.
* **Temporal Error:** Deviations (Late or Early) generate gradients.
* **Phantom Latency:** Virtual modules possess a small non-zero latency constant to prevent infinite temporal error derivatives during the Virtual $\to$ Real transition.

# 5. The Computational Substrate (Recursive Expression Engine)

## 5.1 The Core (Recursive Syntax Tree)
The Core is no longer a fixed topology but a **Recursive Expression Engine**. It parses a nested syntax tree of operations, allowing the architecture to evolve from standard Attention to arbitrary computational graphs.
* **The Mixing Node (N-ary Pipe):** The fundamental operator is a **Sequential Left-Associative Reduction**. It accepts an arbitrary list of children `[A, B, C...]` and reduces them step-by-step: `((A · B) · C)...`
    * **Generalized Interaction:** The system dynamically determines the interaction type based on dimensionality (e.g., creating an affinity map vs. applying a map vs. element-wise mixing).
* **Continuous Normalization (`Phi`):** Discrete layers (Softmax, LayerNorm) are replaced by a **Learnable Continuous Manifold**.
    * **The Function:** `Phi(x)` applies a learnable spline-based transformation, allowing the node to evolve smoothly between Identity (Linear), Softmax (Competitive), and Sigmoid (Gating) behaviors during training.

## 5.2 The Atom (Generalized Primitive)
The Atom is the leaf of the syntax tree, acting as a learnable projection unit that feeds the Expression Engine.
* **Cylindrical Time (The Spiral):** To handle infinite context without losing local precision, the Atom applies **Hierarchical Rotary Embeddings**.
    * **Hour Axis (High-Freq):** Standard RoPE for local relative syntax.
    * **Day Axis (Low-Freq):** Global spiral rotation for long-term sequence tracking.
* **Initialization Physics:**
    * **Active Atoms (Q):** Initialized with random orthogonal weights to create divergent "Query" projections.
    * **Passive Atoms (K/V):** Initialized as Identity to facilitate stable signal pass-through at the start of training.
* **Factorized Feature:** The output remains a composite of **Spline** (Magnitude), **Dual-Axis Permutation** (Geometry), and **Noise** (Entropy).

# 6. Universal Linearization & Scale

## 6.1 Dual-Path Interface
* **Metric Path:** N-dimensional grids are linearized via **Z-Order Curves** (Morton Codes) to preserve locality in 1D streams.
* **Relational Path:** Graphs are linearized via **Spectral Ordering** (Fiedler Vectors).

## 6.2 Fractal Scale Equivariance
The system models scale as a flow between Geometry and Entropy (Renormalization).
* **Fractal Head:** Uses the Entropy parameter to predict and generate high-frequency jitter during upsampling, ensuring scale equivariance.
