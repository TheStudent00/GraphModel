# Graph Model Intellectual Property (IP) Description
**Version 10 — Parametric Functional Physics**

This document captures the conceptual, architectural, and theoretical foundations of the Graph Model Oracle, defining the novel components, structural primitives, and meta-learning dynamics protected under the OTU Green License.

Version 10 introduces **Parametric Functional Physics** (Polynomial Convolution), replacing discrete vector arithmetic with continuous function interference. This integrates with the **Recursive Expression Engine** (V9 Grammar) and **Fractal Topology** (V6-V8) to create a **Differentiable Analog Computer** capable of processing variable-rate signals with infinite resolution.

# 1. Purpose and Scope

This description asserts IP protection over:

- **The Recursive Fractal Architecture:** The nesting of Modules within Modules (Internal Sparsity).
- **LossComplexity (The Relativistic Barrier):** A regulatory energy model where complexity cost asymptotes to infinity near the limit.
- **Recursive Expression Engine:** A grammatical compute model replacing fixed topologies with learnable syntax trees (The Pipe).
- **Parametric Functional Physics:** A computational substrate where "Attention" is redefined as the **Polynomial Convolution** (Superposition) of continuous signal shapes.
- **Analytic Moment Projection (The Accordion):** A method of embedding variable-length token streams ($M$ segments) into fixed-length Feature Templates ($N$ segments) via integral moment preservation, handling Expansion, Maintenance, and Reduction continuously.
- **Fog of War (Entropy Gating):** A physical model of position where distance injects **Variance** ($\sigma$) into interactions, naturally dampening long-range signals.
- **Parametric Poly-Tokenization:** A recursive signal compression algorithm that treats Text (Micro) and Images (Macro) as variable-length cubic segments.
- **The Functional Token:** The fundamental unit of information `[Shape, Sigma, Mass, Position]`.
- **Learnable Phi (Energy Valve):** A continuous normalization gate for Mass/Energy.
- **Impedance Regulation:** Connection costs based on Fractal Tree Distance.
- **Bicameral Autopoiesis:** Active (Read-Only) vs. Reflective (Write-Access) Minds.

# 2. High-Level Summary

The Graph Model is a **Fractal Organism**. It is composed of **Minds** (Hemispheres), which contain **Modules**, which recursively contain **Sub-Modules**.

Computationally, the system abandons fixed layers in favor of a **Recursive Expression Engine**. Instead of a static architecture, Modules parse learnable syntax trees, executing a **Sequential Reduction** (Pipe) on inputs. To handle unbounded streams, it utilizes **Cylindrical Time**, mapping linear sequence data into a hierarchical spiral (Day/Hour).

The system is regulated by a **Dual-Economy**:
1.  **Internal Economy (LossComplexity):** A relativistic budget constraint that governs the expansion of the fractal (Parent distributes tokens to Children).
2.  **External Economy (Logistics):** A market mechanism that governs the flow of information between modules (Sender pays Time, Receiver pays Space).

# 3. The Fractal Hierarchy

## 3.1 The Mind (Global Container)
The highest level of abstraction, organized Bicamerally to ensure safety during self-modification.
* **Active Mind (Hemisphere A):** Real-time, read-only execution. Optimized for inference speed. Uses **Universal Linearization** (Z-Order/Spectral) to ingest any data type.
* **Reflective Mind (Hemisphere B):** Deep-time, write-enabled simulation. Contains **Version Control** (Backtracking) and the **MindsEye** executive.

## 3.2 The Module (Recursive Agent)
A Module is a self-similar container acting as both a computational unit and a structural node.
* **Public Face (The Trinity):** The default computational cycle: Context (Sensor) $\to$ State (Integrator) $\to$ Service (Actuator).
* **Private Internals (Internal Sparsity):** A list of **Sub-Modules**. These are strictly private implementation details, allowing a Module to become a complex network internally without exposing that complexity to the global graph.
* **Virtual Identity:** Modules exist virtually (consuming zero complexity) until accessed. Upon realization, they incur a **Phantom Latency** to smooth the gradient shock to the Rhythm system.

---

# 4. The Economic Physics (Regulation)

## 4.1 LossComplexity (The Relativistic Barrier)
To prevent unbounded expansion, every Module enforces a **Relativistic Barrier** on its total complexity mass (Self + Realized Sub-Modules).
* **The Barrier Function:** $Cost \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (C/C_{limit})^2}}$.
* **Effect:** As a module approaches its complexity limit, the "cost" of adding a new atom or realizing a sub-module approaches infinity. This forces the optimization landscape to prioritize **Compression** and **Sparsity** over expansion.

## 4.2 Impedance (Topological Regulation)
Connections between Public Modules are regulated by the **Impedance Curve**.
* **Tree Distance:** Cost is calculated based on the shortest path in the recursion tree ($\Delta L$).
* **Function:** $Cost(\Delta L)$ is a learnable monotone spline. This prevents "Small World" collapse by making long-range or cross-branch connections expensive (high Space token cost).

## 4.3 Internal Rhythm (Temporal Regulation)
The system optimizes for **Isochrony** (predictable timing).
* **ETA Prediction:** Modules predict response latency.
* **Temporal Error:** Deviations (Late or Early) generate gradients.
* **Phantom Latency:** Virtual modules possess a small non-zero latency constant to prevent infinite temporal error derivatives during the Virtual $\to$ Real transition.

# 5. The Computational Substrate (V10 Functional Core)

## 5.1 The Core (Recursive Interference Engine)
The Core preserves the recursive "Pipe" topology of V9 but upgrades the interaction mechanism from Vector Dot-Products to **Functional Superposition**.
* **The Mixing Node (Functional Convolution):** The fundamental operator is no longer a matrix multiplication, but a **Polynomial Convolution**. 
    * **Mechanism:** It convolves the "Shape" of input signals (Cubic Curves) to generate a **Resonance Pattern**, which modulates the value stream.
    * **Fog of War (Entropy Gating):** Instead of rotary embeddings, the node injects **Distance-Based Variance** ($\sigma^2 \propto \log(\Delta x)$) into the interaction. This physically dampens long-range signals unless their Mass (Amplitude) is high enough to pierce the uncertainty.

## 5.2 The Atom (Parametric Warp Unit)
The Atom remains the fundamental leaf node, but its role shifts from Vector Projection to **Analytic Moment Projection (The Accordion)**.
* **The Template Curve:** The Atom contains a learnable, multi-segment continuous spline ($N$ segments) acting as the Embedding Space.
* **The Projection:** It maps the Input Token stream ($M$ segments) onto the Template Basis ($N$ segments) using **Integral Moment Preservation**.
    * **Expansion (M < N):** The input signal is smoothly interpolated ("stretched") to modulate the larger template.
    * **Reduction (M > N):** The input signal is analytically downsampled ("squished"), effectively filtering high-frequency details (Texture) into the lower-frequency domain of the template.
    * **Modulation:** The projected input signal modulates the Template Coefficients, creating a **Warped Feature Map** that preserves continuity and differentiability.

## 5.3 Learnable Phi (The Energy Valve)
The Continuous Normalization function (`Phi`) now acts as a **Conservation Governor**.
* **Role:** It regulates the **Mass** (Energy) of the interaction.
* **Logic:** It applies a learnable non-linear gate (Tanh/Sigmoid) to the raw interaction energy, preventing the "Exploding Amplitude" problem inherent in wave interference systems.

# 6. The Universal Substrate (Parametric Input)

## 6.1 Recursive Poly-Tokenization
The Interface abandons discrete pixel embedding for **Parametric Signal Compression**.
* **The Sensor:** A recursive "Physics Fitter" scans the Z-Order stream.
* **The Logic:** It fits cubic polynomials to the signal, splitting recursively based on **Structural Residuals** (distinguishing Texture from Geometry).
    * **Macro-Tokens:** Smooth gradients are captured by single long-range polynomials.
    * **Micro-Tokens:** High-frequency data (Text/Edges) forces the recursion to split down to the interpolation limit, creating a lossless representation.

## 6.2 The Functional Token
The fundamental unit of information is a **Cubic Bundle** containing:
* **Shape:** The Polynomial Coefficients ($at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d$).
* **Sigma ($\sigma$):** The Texture/Uncertainty (Avg deviation from the fit).
* **Mass:** The Energy/Amplitude of the signal.
* **Position:** Absolute Z-Order Index (Metadata).

## 6.3 Fog of War (Positional Physics)
Distance is modeled as **Entropy Injection**.
* Instead of rotating vectors (RoPE), the system injects variance into the interaction based on distance: $\sigma_{total}^2 = \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 + \alpha \log(1 + \Delta x)$.
* This naturally dampens long-range interactions unless the signal "Mass" is high enough to pierce the uncertainty.
